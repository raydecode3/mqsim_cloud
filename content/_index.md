### The "Unspoken" Truth of Firmware Engineering

Let me ask you a question. **How much time did you spend coding actual FTL algorithms last week?**

And how much time did you spend on:
* 🔧 Fixing `glibc` version conflicts?
* 🐳 Debugging Docker volume permissions?
* ⏳ Waiting for the `make` command to finish, only to see it fail at 99%?

If you are like most of us, the ratio is probably **30% Architecture, 70% Plumbing.**

> **"We are hired to solve Write Amplification, not to fix Linux dependencies."**

<br>

### The Nightmare Scenario

Does this terminal output look familiar?

    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system
    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
    make: *** [Makefile:42: mqsim] Error 1

Every time you see this, a part of your creativity dies. The complex **Garbage Collection** logic you were holding in your head evaporates because you have to switch context to "SysAdmin Mode."

This is the friction that kills innovation.

### The Solution: MQSim Cloud

I built **MQSim Cloud** for one simple reason: **To let you focus on the algorithm.**

Think of it as the "Serverless" platform for SSD Simulation.

- ✅ **No Installation:** Upload your `ssdconfig.xml`.
- ✅ **Instant Feedback:** We run the simulation on optimized cloud instances.
- ✅ **Visual Reports:** Get Latency & Throughput graphs automatically.
- ❌ **No More Dependency Hell.**

I handle the Linux environment. You handle the SSD logic.

<br>

### Who is this for?

This is not for everyone. This is for the **Architects**.

* If you want to understand why your **Tail Latency (p99)** is high.
* If you want to test a new **Wear Leveling** strategy without buying hardware.
* If you want to learn **NVMe Protocols** by doing, not just reading.
