summary: "Setting up MQSim takes 3 days. Running a simulation takes 30 seconds. Let's fix this ratio."

## The Problem: We spend too much time plumbing.

As a firmware engineer, I want to test my FTL (Flash Translation Layer) algorithm.
I don't want to debug `glibc` versions, fix Makefiles, or configure Docker containers.

But that's what we do. We are the "Plumbers" of the tech world.

## The Solution: MQSim Cloud

I built this platform for one reason: **To let you focus on the algorithm.**

1. Upload your `ssdconfig.xml`.
2. We run the simulation on high-performance cloud servers.
3. You get the Latency & Throughput report in your inbox.

### Want to learn how it works?

I am also recording a masterclass on **NVMe SSD Architecture**.
